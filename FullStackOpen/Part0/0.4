title Exercise 0.4 "New Note"

Browser->Server:  HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note
Server->Browser: HTML-CODE  URL redirect

note over browser:

Browser request to the server address new_note. The server responds with HTTP status code 302.
This is a URL redirect, with which the server asks the browser to do a new HTTP GET request
to the address defined in the header's Location. So, the browser reloads the Notes page.

There is also data submitted thanks to the form data that has attributes action and method, 
which define that submitting the form is done as an HTTP POST request to the address new_note.
Data is sent as the body of the POST-request.
The Server creates a new note object, and adds it to an array called notes.
The Note objects have two fields: content containing the actual content of the note, and date 
containing the date and time the note was created.
