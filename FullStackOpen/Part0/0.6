title Exercise 0.6 "New note"

Browser->Server:  HTTP POST https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
Server->Browser: application/json;

note over browser:
The POST request to the address new_note_spa contains the new note as JSON-data containing
both the content of the note (content) and the timestamp (date).

The server responds with statuscode 201 created. This time the server does not ask for a redirect, 
the browser stays on the same page, and it sends no further HTTP-requests.

The Single page app version of the app does not send the form data the traditional way, but instead 
uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server. The new note is created and will appear in the page.
